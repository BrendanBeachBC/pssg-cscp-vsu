    <p>The Victim Travel Fund provides funding to facilitate victim or immediate family member attendance and participation in criminal
        justice proceedings taking place in criminal court in BC. Funding may also be available to attend BC Review Board hearings. The maximum
        amount of funding that can be provided in relation to a case is $3,000.00. This funding limit may be distributed over multiple
        court/Review Board hearing dates and is distributed between eligible applicants on a case (see below).
    </p>

    <p>Eligible expenses may include accommodation and the most economical form of travel. Applications should be submitted at least 3 weeks
        prior to travel when possible and a maximum of 3 months following travel.</p>


    <p>Funding is available to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Victims who have suffered physical or emotional harm as a result of a serious criminal offence. If the victim requires a support person in order to
            attend and participate in the justice proceedings, one support person may also be eligible to apply.</li>
        <li>Immediate family members of a deceased victim. Eligible immediate family members include parents, spouse, children and siblings as defined in
            the <a href="https://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96478_01" target="_blank" title="Victims of Crime Act">Victims of Crime Act</a>.
